## Review

Fairly lightweight program that runs fairly smooth. I have ran into some crashes. Save soon, save often.

There are a variety of reviews on the page but some of them I don't really believe because they have very little time using the tool and some of the complaints just aren't true. That isn't to say that the program isn't without problems. As I said, I have had crashes from it. 

It shows some potential and when used for basic dialogue works great. You will have to create your own way to process the json file. There's a lot of negatives when you weigh it against other tools that do the same thing.

At this level of development (11/23), I would not recommend it but that may change as there is potential.
